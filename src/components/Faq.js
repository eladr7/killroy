          <p>
            Your Council of Gyld NFT, or your Cryptid, is your access point into
            the Legendao universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you collect a Council of Gyld NFT, you initially receive a 2D
            Cryptid avatar to use on the Legendao platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will entitle you to a free 3D Cryptid avatar for use in Phase 2
            of the Legendao Universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your 2D Cryptid avatar also grants you Legendao OG status. OGs enjoy
            amazing NFT and staking opportunities that will never be accessible
            at any other time except during the initial Council of Gyld drop.

          IS THE 2D COUNCIL OF GYLD COLLECTION PART OF THE 3D LEGENDAO UNIVERSE?{" "}
        </button>
        <div className="panel">
          <p>
            Yes. The 2D Council of Gyld collection is the technical base for the
            3D Cryptids collection and currently interacts with the Legendao
            platform in most of the 3D capacities like collecting, staking and
            earning XP.

          WHY SHOULD I BUY A COUNCIL OF GYLD NFT?{" "}
        </button>
        <div className="panel">
          <p>
            It looks awesome and the free 3D avatar dropped to you later will
            look even more awesome.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Council of Gyld NFT is the initial key entitling you to staking,
            collecting and earning privileges that will never be available again
            after the initial drop.
          </p>
          <p>
            With your Council of Gyld NFT, you get a whitelist spot for
            Legendao's first blue-chip NFT collection and a free digital
            wearable - an exclusive pair of wings that will mark you forever as
            a Legendao OG.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be no way to buy or transfer the perks provided by the
            Council of Gyld drop ever again.
